# LEARNING C/C++ BY DEVELOPING A POKEMON GAME 

Currently developing a pokemon game in C and C++
Adding new changes every week !
Things done till now :
1. Build standard Map with intersecting paths, pokemon centers and pokemarts which are all randomly generated with multiple kinds of terrains for the players to travel through
2. Connected 401 * 401 maps to make a world with different maps for player to traverse through using keyboards inputs, player can also fly to a map in a different region
3. Added a playing character to the map and generated shortest distances for all "hiker" and "rival" (non-playing characters or NPC's) till the playing characters based on different terrains having differing distance values for various kinds of NPC's.
4. Developing movement constraints for all the non-player characters and running a simulation until user asks to exit. Next steps include adding UI, making player move through user inputs and converting parts of code to C++!
