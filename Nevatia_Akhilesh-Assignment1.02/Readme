Commands:
n: Move to the map immediately north of the current map and display it.
s: Move to the map immediately south of the current map and display it.
e: Move to the map immediately east of the current map and display it.
w: Move to the map immediately west of the current map and display it.
f x y: Fly to map (x, y) and display it.
q: Quit the game.

Boundary Handling:
Movement commands that would cause the display to move off the edge of the world are ignored.
Display the coordinates of the current map beneath the map itself at all times.

Building Placement:
The levels of wild-spawned Pokémon will be a function of the distance from the center.
The frequency of Poké Marts and Pokémon Centers will decline as the player moves outwards from the center.
Map Generation and Gates:
Initially, all maps in the 401 × 401 array are NULL except for the center map at (200, 200).
Gates are used to connect maps, and when generating adjacent maps, gates should match up appropriately.
Map Storage and Revisiting:
No map should be generated until it is visited.
All visited maps should be saved so they can be revisited by going to the original coordinates.

Edge Maps:
Maps on the edges of the world should not have gates on their world-bordering edges.
The suggested approach involves using a 401 × 401 array of pointers to maps. Initially, all maps are NULL except for the center map. When generating a new map, memory is dynamically allocated, and the pointer to the map is stored in the appropriate position in the array. To check for the existence of a map, one simply tests the corresponding pointer for NULL.

Usage:
- To run the code, just type "make run" after going inside the folder
- To remove executable type "make clean"
- to only generate executable type "make", and sepeately see the map - "./MaptoMap"
