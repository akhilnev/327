Overview of 1.06 
This project revisits the creation of a world full of maps and the implementation of movement between these maps. The functionality of moving through gates will be reintroduced behind a new Curses-based user interface. The player character (PC) will be able to navigate through gates into the adjacent maps, positioned on the road square corresponding to the gate's location.

Gate Movement
PC Movement: The PC can move into a gate, transferring to the adjacent map by positioning the PC at the road square opposite the gate's location.
NPCs: Non-Player Characters cannot move through gates.
Turn Queues: Maintain turn queues per map. Time doesn't progress in maps where the PC is absent.
Flying Mechanism
Implementing the 'fly' command through the Curses interface, similar to version 1.02.
The 'f' command triggers the flying action, allowing the player to input X and Y coordinates to relocate within the destination map (commonly on the road).
Turn queues and NPC positions remain consistent even while flying.
Porting to C++
Renaming C files to .cpp extensions, adjusting the makefile for compilation with C++.
Major structs in the game to be transformed into classes, including map and character structures.
Pseudo-object-oriented design of character t to be replaced by C++ class inheritance, with pc and npc inheriting from character.
No alterations needed in heap.h and heap.c as they already support C++ syntax.


Notes to TA : 
- Please do "make all" to run the files and then "./poke327" to get the output
- Please do "make clean" to remove all executables which have been made before
