 COMS S 327: Programming Assignment 4

 Author: Akhilesh Nevatia 

 Title: Player Character and Trainers

 Description: This is the fourth assignment based on the Pokemon game. It is a continuation of the previous assignment, where we calcualted the movement 
 path for hikers and rivals, along with adding other adversary to our game.
 In this assignment, we take a step ahead and add a player character (@) and other Pokemon trainers. Since the game is driven by a priority queue, all the 
 characters are placed in the queue and removed according to the time of their next move. We have a total of 7 different kinds of NPC's represented by different
 annotations. I have used the Dijkstras algorithm to find the shortest and most efficient path for the movement of these characters, and various other void
 functions to track the positions of the characters on the map.

 The main objective of this assignment is to add the characters and track their movement along with the hkers and rivals.

 NOTES :
 numtrainers is standard set to 10 in the makefile and standard sleep time 250000 is used as mentioned in the document !
